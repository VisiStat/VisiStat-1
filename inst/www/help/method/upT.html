<b>An unpaired t-test</b> is used when there are 2 conditions are compared and they are unpaired (i.e., between-groups factor). Unpaired t-test can be used only when the distributions are normal and homogeneity of variances is met (i.e., the distributions have equal variances).
</div>    
        
<h2>Conditions:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Between-subjects experimental design</li>
    <li>The number of Independent Variable is one</li>
    <li>The number of levels in Independent Variable are two</li>
    <li>The dependent variable is in interval scale</li>
    <li>The dependent variable is normally-distributed in each condition</li>
    <li>Homogeneity of variances (i.e., variances approximately equal across groups)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<div class="example">
<b>Example 1:</b> In a text entry user study, two keyboard layouts (QWERTY and DVORAK) were compared in a between-subjects experimental design. As shown in the graph below, the measured task completion time were normally distributed in each condition, but their variance were radically different. This violates the assumption of homogeniety of variance of unpaired t-tests.

<div class="example">
<b>Example 2:</b> In a weight loss user study, weight lost of participants is considered under two different conditions (skip breakfast and skip lunch), which were compared in a between-subjects experimental design. As shown in the graph below, the measured wight lost was normally distributed in each condition, and their variance were about the same.

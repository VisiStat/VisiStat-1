<b>Welch's ANOVA</b> is used when 3 or more conditions are compared and the independent variable is a between-groups factor (different participants are used for different conditions). It is an alternative to the one-way ANOVA. It can be used used when homogeneity of variances is not met (i.e., the distributions have unequal variances). It still requires the distributions to follow normal distributions.

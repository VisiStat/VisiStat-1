<b>Two-way ANOVA</b> is used when there are 2 independent variables (both must be between-groups factor) and a dependent variable. It is used to see the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable as well as the interaction between the independent variables.
</div>    
        
<h2>Conditions:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Between-subjects experimental design</li>
    <li>The number of Independent Variable are two</li>
    <li>The number of levels in Independent Variable are more than two</li>
        <li>Two independent variables should each consist of two or more categorical, independent groups</li>
    <li>Dependent variable should be measured at the interval or ratio level (i.e., they are continuous)</li>
     <li> Your dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed for each combination of the groups of the two independent variables</li>
    <li>The populations from which the samples were obtained must be normally or approximately normally distributed
    </li>
    <li>There should be no significant outliers</li>
    <li>There needs to be homogeneity of variances for each combination of the groups of the two independent variables</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<!-- TODO: Use interaction plot instead -->
<div class="example">
<b>Example 1:</b> In a weight loss user study, weight lost of participants is considered under four different conditions (skip breakfast, skip lunch, skip dinner and control) and excercise is considered at three different levels(none , high , low), which were compared in a between-subjects experimental design. As shown in the graph below, the measured wight lost was normally distributed in each condition, and their variance were about the same.

<div class="example">
<b>Example 2:</b> In a text entry user study, three keyboard layouts (QWERTY and DVORAK and Colemak) and two gender levels( male and female)  were compared in a between-subjects experimental design. As shown in the graph below, the measured task completion time were normally distributed in each condition, and their variance were radically same.

<b>Mannâ€“Whitney U test</b> (also called the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is used when 2 conditions are compared and they are unpaired (i.e., between-groups factor). It is an alternative test for unpaired t-test. It is used when the distributions are not normal. It still requires the homogeneity of variances to hold (i.e., the distributions should have equal variance).

<h2>Conditions:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Within-subjects experimental design</li>
    <li>The number of Independent Variable is one</li>
    <li>The number of levels in Independent Variable are two</li>
    <li>Your independent variable should consist of two categorical, independent groups</li>
    <li>The dependent variable should be measured at ordinal or continous scale</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<div class="example">
<b>Example 1:</b> In a weight loss user study, excercise of participants is considered under two different conditions (none and high), which were compared in a between-subjects experimental design. As shown in the graph below, the measured user rating was not normally distributed in each condition, but their variance were about the same.

<b>Example 2:</b> In a weight loss user study, wight loss of participants is considered under two different conditions (no breakfast and no lunch), which were compared in a between-subjects experimental design. As shown in the graph below, the measured user rating was not normally distributed in each condition, but their variance were about the same.

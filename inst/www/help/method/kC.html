<b>Kendall's correlation coefficient</b> is used to find correlation (the direction of change in one variable as the other variable changes) when an interval variable is present. It has a range of -1 to +1. -1 implies that one variable decreases as the other increases (negative correlation) and +1 implies one variable increases as the other increases (positive correlation). 0 implies there is no dependence between the two variables.

<h2>Conditions:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Variables either scalar or ordinal
    </li>
    <li>The relationship between the 2 variables is monotonic</li>
</ul>

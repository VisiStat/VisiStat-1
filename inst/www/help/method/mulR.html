<b> Multiple regression</b> is an extension of linear regression where we construct a model to predict the outcome variable from multiple causal/explanatory variables.
</div>    
        
<h2>Conditions:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Variables under examination should be measured in interval or ratio scale  
    </li>
    <li> Two or more independent variables which either are in ratio/interval scale or ordinal/nominal scale
    </li>
    <li> Variables should have a linear relationshio between the independent and dependent variable
    </li>
    <li> Variables should not have significant outliners
    </li>
    <li> Data collected for the two variables under examination should have homoscedasticity and should not show multicollinearity
    </li>
    <li> The residuals(errors) of the regression line are approximatelynormally distributed
    </li>
</ul>
        
        <p><b>homoscedasticity</b>  is where the variances along the line of best fit remain similar as you move along the line. Whilst we explain more about what this means and how to assess the homoscedasticity of your data in our enhanced linear regression line, take a look at the two scatterplots below, which provide two simple examples: one of data that meets this assumption and one that fails the assumption.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>When you analyse your own data, you will be lucky if your scatterplot looks like either of the two above. Whilst these help to illustrate the differences in data that meets or violates the assumption of homoscedasticity, real-world data is often a lot more messy. </p>

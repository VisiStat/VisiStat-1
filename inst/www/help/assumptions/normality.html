<b>Normality</b>  <br/> This assumption is met when the distributions that are compared are normally distributed. A normal-distribution or Gaussian distribution can be identified by a characteristic bell-shaped curve.
</div>    
        
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<div class="example">
<b>Example 1: Data not normally distributed</b> <br/> Fitts law experiment conducted with 10 candidates and histogram created for 80 data points for task completion in milliseconds.

    Note: Data might be insufficient to figure out whether its normality.

        <div class="example">
<b>Example 2: Data almost normally distributed</b> Height of 40 men plotted.
<img src="images/normality_2.png"/>
<br/>
    Note: More data would clearly show its normality.

var description = new Object();    description["histogram"] = "A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable and was first introduced by Karl Pearson.[1] A histogram is a representation of tabulated frequencies, shown as adjacent rectangles, erected over discrete intervals (bins), with an area equal to the frequency of the observations in the interval. The height of a rectangle is also equal to the frequency density of the interval, i.e., the frequency divided by the width of the interval. The total area of the histogram is equal to the number of data.";    description["boxplot"] = "A box plot or boxplot is a convenient way of graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. Box plots have lines extending vertically from the boxes (whiskers) indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, hence the terms box-and-whisker plot and box-and-whisker diagram. Outliers may be plotted as individual points.";    description["scatterplot"] = "A scatter plot, scatterplot, or scattergraph is a type of mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for two variables for a set of data. The data is displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis.";    description["scatterplot-matrix"] = "Given a set of variables X1, X2, ... , Xk, the scatterplot matrix contains all the pairwise scatter plots of the variables on a single page in a matrix format. That is, if there are k variables, the scatterplot matrix will have k rows and k columns and the ith row and jth column of this matrix is a plot of Xi versus Xj.";
